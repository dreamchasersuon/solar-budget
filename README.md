Solar Budget is mobile finance-flow management application.
Currently in development.

To run this project locally you need to download it. Also, you need to have the latest Android Studio installed to build the application (cause its ejected app: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/expokit/eject/) and Expo Cli (https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/):

1. run `git clone https://github.com/dreamchasersuon/solar-budget.git`
in directory of your choice;
2. got to `cd solar-budget`;
3. run `yarn` to initialize dependencies;
4. run `expo start` to open metro bundler (make sure to install expo `expo cli` first;
5. install `expo client` on your phone and authorize in with your credentials (same for `expo cli`).

If you want to complete the issue add a comment like 'Working on it' and label "In progress" make sure to create new branch with tag of issue (e.g #3). Redux logic and plain functions should be covered by tests.
